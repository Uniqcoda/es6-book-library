# SCHOOL BOOK LIBRARY

## A School Library where users (students and teachers) can borrow and return books. It is also an exercise to practise how to convert an ES5 project to ES6.

### Considerations to follow;

* All resources should have methods for creating, reading, updating, deleting and searching on them.

* A user can only have at most 3 books in his/her possession at any time.

* When the copy of a book is no longer in the library. The library should return "book taken".

* There can be multiple copies of the same book in the library.

* The quantity (copies) of a book will increase when more copies of the book is supplied to the library.

* The books are given on a first-come-first-serve basis, but when a teacher is requesting for the same book a student is requesting for, the teacher comes first. Also, when a junior student is asking for the same book a senior student is asking for, the senior student comes first.

* Borrowed books should be returned and accounted for.

### Rules

1. Write extremely clean code.
2. Commenting is also extremely important.
3. Have a good git work flow.
4. TDD is non-negotiable. A code coverage of at least 97%.

Note: This project was initially written in ES5 but recently refactored to ES6.
